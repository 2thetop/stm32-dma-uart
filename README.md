# STM32 Circular DMA with Timeout Event
This example presents how to implement performance-effective DMA timeout mechanism for peripheral DMA configured in circular mode.

Implementing DMA for peripheries can significantly boost performance while reducing workload on the microcontroller core. Configuring DMA in circular mode can be straightforward for peripheries, however often the received amount of data is unpredictable.
